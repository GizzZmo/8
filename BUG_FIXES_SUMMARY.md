# Bug Fixes and Documentation Updates Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical Bug: PhysicalLayer.decapsulate() using unsafe eval()

**Issue:** The physical layer was using `eval()` to deserialize data, which:
- Caused a `NameError: name 'PDU' is not defined` 
- Is a security vulnerability
- Prevented the simulation from completing successfully

**Fix:** Replaced `eval()` with proper `pickle` serialization/deserialization

**Impact:** All simulation scenarios now complete successfully

### 2. Bug: PresentationLayer signature verification order

**Issue:** When both encryption and signing were enabled, signature verification failed because:
- Signature was computed on encrypted data during encapsulation
- But was verified on decrypted data during decapsulation

**Fix:** Reordered decapsulation to verify signature BEFORE decryption

**Impact:** Combined encryption + signing scenarios now work correctly

### 3. Bug: Example scripts using incorrect calling convention

**Issue:** All example scripts were calling `simulate_flow()` incorrectly:
- Some used direct function calls with keyword arguments (not supported)
- Others manipulated `sys.argv` (fragile and inconsistent)

**Fix:** Updated all example scripts to use `argparse.Namespace` objects

**Impact:** All example scripts now run successfully

### 4. Documentation: Inaccurate root readme.md

**Issue:** The root `readme.md` described a "Fractal Mythos Explorer" project that didn't match the actual repository contents

**Fix:** Completely rewrote `readme.md` to accurately describe:
- OSI Blockchain Simulation component
- Fractal Mythos Explorer (index.html) component
- GitHub workflow configuration documentation

**Impact:** Repository documentation now accurately reflects actual contents

### 5. Documentation: Outdated todo.md

**Issue:** The `todo.md` contained old code snippets and incomplete implementation notes

**Fix:** Updated to reflect:
- Completed tasks
- Current implementation status
- Usage instructions
- Future enhancement ideas

**Impact:** Clear documentation of project status and usage

## Testing Results

All test scenarios now pass successfully:

```
✅ Test 1: Basic Text Transmission
✅ Test 2: Encrypted Transmission  
✅ Test 3: Signed Transmission
✅ Test 4: Blockchain Transaction
✅ Test 5: Combined (Encrypt + Sign)
```

All example scripts execute successfully:

```
✅ examples/simple_text_flow.py
✅ examples/encrypted_data_flow.py
✅ examples/signed_data_flow.py
✅ examples/blockchain_flow.py
```
